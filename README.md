# [EmojiBuilder](https://emoji.debijl.xyz/)

## Summary:

Use Twitter's Open Source SVG emoji to build your own emoji/abominations.

## Roadmap:  

EmojiBuilder is currently very much in beta, check out the [roadmap project](https://github.com/Fdebijl/EmojiBuilder/projects/1) for all the function that should be implemented shortly. If you think something is missing, put in an issue above!

## Contributing:

If you have a stellar idea to implement one of the above functions, go ahead and put in a pull request or issue with your suggestion! I dont really adhere to any particular standard, but try to follow best JS practices and some degree of commenting in your code.
